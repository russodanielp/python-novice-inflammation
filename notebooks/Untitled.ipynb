    "In the last lesson,\n",
    "we wrote some code that plots some values of interest from our first inflammation dataset,\n",
    "and reveals some suspicious features in it, such as from `inflammation-01.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Analysis of inflammation-01.csv](../fig/03-loop_2_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a dozen data sets right now, though, and more on the way.\n",
    "We want to create plots for all of our data sets with a single statement.\n",
    "To do that, we'll have to teach the computer how to repeat things.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example task that we might want to repeat is printing each character in a\n",
    "word on a line of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "word = 'lead'\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "{: .python}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access a character in a string using its index. For example, we can get the first\n",
    "character of the word 'lead', by using word[0]. One way to print each character is to use\n",
    "four `print` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "print(word[0])\n",
    "print(word[1])\n",
    "print(word[2])\n",

    "This is a bad approach for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It doesn't scale:\n",
    "    if we want to print the characters in a string that's hundreds of letters long,\n",
    "    we'd be better off just typing them in.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It's fragile:\n",
    "    if we give it a longer string,\n",
    "    it only prints part of the data,\n",
    "    and if we give it a shorter one,\n",
    "    it produces an error because we're asking for characters that don't exist.\n",

    "The improved version uses a [for loop](reference.html#for-loop)\n",

    "\n",
    "where each character (`char`) in the variable `word` is looped through and printed one character after another.\n",
    "The numbers in the diagram denote which loop cycle the character was printed in (1 being the first loop, and 6 being the final loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call the [loop variable](reference.html#loop-variable) anything we like,\n",
    "but there must be a colon at the end of the line starting the loop,\n",
    "and we must indent anything we want to run inside the loop. Unlike many other languages, there is no\n",
    "command to signify the end of the loop body (e.g. end for); what is indented after the for statement belongs to the loop.\n",

    "`length` is zero (the value assigned to it on line 1)\n",
    "and `vowel` is `'a'`.\n",
    "The statement adds 1 to the old value of `length`,\n",
    "producing 1,\n",
    "and updates `length` to refer to that new value.\n",

    "the loop finishes\n",
    "and the `print` statement on line 4 tells us our final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a loop variable is just a variable that's being used to record progress in a loop.\n",
