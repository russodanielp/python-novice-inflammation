Here, the for loop allowed us to print each letter in `word`, but stopped when there were no longer any elements in the variable.  This is the general concept of a `for` loop, for each _element_ in a _collection_ do something to that _element_.  In our example above, the statment `for char in word` for each _element_ (letter) in our _collection_ (word) assign it to the variable `char`.  This allows us to treat `char` like we would any other variable in python, with the difference being that `char` will take on a different value through each element of our collection.

We could accomplish that using a `for` loop."
