    "Python has a built-in function called range that creates a sequence of numbers. Range can accept 1-3 parameters. If one parameter is input, range creates an array of that length, starting at zero and incrementing by 1. If 2 parameters are input, range starts at the first and ends just before the second, incrementing by one. If range is passed 3 parameters, it starts at the first one, ends just before the second one, and increments by the third one. For example, range(3) produces the numbers 0, 1, 2, while range(2, 5) produces 2, 3, 4, and range(3, 10, 3) produces 3, 6, 9. Using range, write a loop that uses range to print the first 3 natural numbers:\n",
